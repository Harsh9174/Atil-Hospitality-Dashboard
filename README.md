# AtilQ-Hospitality-Dashboard

# Description
#### The Leading Hospitality Chain Data Analysis project involves an in-depth analysis of multiple datasets related to a prominent hospitality chain. Through this analysis, the project aims to identify valuable trends and patterns in customer behavior and preferences. Leveraging Python, the data is thoroughly cleaned and processed to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

#### To effectively communicate and visualize the insights obtained from the data, a dynamic dashboard is developed using Power BI. The Power BI dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear and interactive representation of the key findings, facilitating data-driven decision-making within the organization.

# Challenges Faced
* Data Cleaning Challenges:
  - Data Source Integration: Consolidating data from diverse sources within the hospitality chain, such as reservations, bookings, and customer feedback, presented challenges in aligning data formats and resolving discrepancies.

 - Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing values in the dataset required careful consideration, as some records might lack critical information, impacting the accuracy of subsequent analysis.

 - Data Anomalies: Detecting and addressing outliers or anomalies in the data was important to ensure that unusual data points didn't skew analysis results and derived insights.

* Dashboard Design Challenges:
 - Visualization Selection: Choosing the right visualizations to represent hospitality-related data, such as occupancy rates or customer feedback sentiment, required careful consideration of the most effective chart types.

 - Balancing Complexity and Simplicity: Striking a balance between presenting comprehensive insights and maintaining a user-friendly interface was challenging to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.

 - Dynamic Data Display: Designing the dashboard to handle real-time data updates and allowing users to interact with different time periods or categories required thoughtful design and development.
